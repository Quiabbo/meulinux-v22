    'steam-os': {
      subtitle: 'Valve\'s gaming-first operating system, based on Arch Linux and optimized for the Steam Deck and PCs.',
      description: 'SteamOS is the Linux-based operating system developed by Valve Corporation, creator of the Steam platform. Originally released in 2013, SteamOS underwent a major overhaul in 2022 with the release of the Steam Deck, reaching version 3.0 — now based on Arch Linux with a rolling release update model.\n\nUnlike general-purpose distributions, SteamOS was designed to offer a console experience on PC hardware: it boots directly into Gaming Mode (Big Picture), supports controllers natively, and runs Steam games — including Windows titles — via the Proton compatibility layer. In 2025, Valve expanded official support to third-party devices like the Lenovo Legion Go S.',
      desktopEnvironments: 'SteamOS operates in two complementary modes. Gaming Mode (Big Picture) is the default, console-style interface, optimized for TV and controller, with direct access to the Steam library. Desktop Mode provides the full KDE Plasma experience, accessible via Steam settings, allowing you to install traditional Linux apps and use the system as a conventional PC.',
      mainFeatures: 'Proton — compatibility layer that allows running thousands of Windows games on Linux with minimal configuration. Steam Input with native and advanced controller support, including full remapping. System updates with an A/B mechanism (automatic rollback in case of failure). Immutable root file system for greater stability. User-configurable TDP and performance limits. Integration with Remote Play and Steam Link. Support for AMD FSR and other upscaling technologies.',
      packageManager: 'SteamOS uses Pacman (native to Arch Linux) as its base, but operates with an immutable root file system by default — direct system modifications are blocked to ensure stability. To install additional apps in Desktop Mode, the recommended way is Flatpak via Flathub, which does not interfere with the system partition.',
      preInstalledSoftware: 'In Gaming Mode, SteamOS directly presents the Steam client with the user\'s full library. In Desktop Mode, available apps include: Firefox (web browser), Discover (Flatpak store), Dolphin (file manager), and standard KDE Plasma apps. Users can install the Heroic Games Launcher for Epic Games and GOG titles.',
      hardwareCompatibility: 'SteamOS was originally developed for the Steam Deck hardware (AMD Zen 2 + RDNA 2). In 2025, official support was expanded to the Lenovo Legion Go S, with more devices planned. Installation on conventional PCs is possible but without official Valve support — the community maintains guides for general use. AMD GPUs have better compatibility in Gaming Mode; NVIDIA is supported with limitations. Minimum requirements: 64-bit Intel/AMD processor · 64 GB HDD/SSD · 8 GB RAM',
      communitySupport: 'The SteamOS community is huge and active on Reddit (r/SteamDeck and r/linux_gaming), Steam Community, and Valve\'s official GitHub. The ProtonDB website (protondb.com) is an essential resource for checking the compatibility of individual games. Detailed wikis cover PC installation and specific hardware configuration.',
      comparison: 'SteamOS does not compete with general-purpose distros like Ubuntu or Fedora — its focus is exclusively on gaming. Compared to gaming distros like Nobara or Pop!_OS, it offers better integration with the Steam ecosystem and Valve hardware, but is less flexible for general desktop use. For those who want a Linux gaming PC with an experience close to a console, SteamOS is the natural choice.'

      description: 'AntiX (pronounced "anti-ics") is a lightweight, fast, and easy-to-install Linux distribution based on Debian Stable and designed for Intel-AMD x86 systems. Its most striking feature is being completely free of systemd and elogind, using SysVinit, Runit, Dinit, or s6 as the init system — a rare and valued characteristic for Linux purists.\n\nOriginally created as a MEPIS variant, AntiX evolved into an independent distribution with a clear philosophy: giving new life to old computers without sacrificing functionality. The X in its name is a direct reference to the project\'s anti-fascist stance and its software freedom philosophy.',
      desktopEnvironments: 'AntiX does not use heavy environments like GNOME or KDE. It adopts lightweight window managers selectable directly from the boot menu: Rox-IceWM (default configuration, combining the ROX file manager with IceWM), ZzzFM-IceWM (alternative with the ZzzFM manager), Fluxbox (an even more minimalist option), and Rox-Fluxbox and ZzzFM-Fluxbox combinations for very limited hardware.',
      mainFeatures: 'Completely free of systemd and elogind, with 4 init systems available. Extremely lightweight: works with just 192 MB of RAM (full version). Support for 32-bit and 64-bit architectures — ideal for old hardware from the Pentium III and IV era. Two kernels included: Legacy 5.10 (very old hardware) and Modern 6.1 (recent hardware). Excellent Live USB support with persistence — changes are saved between reboots. Native remaster tool to create personalized versions of the distro.',
      packageManager: 'AntiX uses APT, inherited from Debian, as its primary manager. In addition to Debian Stable repositories, it maintains its own repository with packages recompiled without systemd/elogind dependencies. The Package Installer (simplified graphical installer) makes it easy to add themed metapackages — such as browsers, network tools, and utilities — for users less familiar with the terminal.',
      preInstalledSoftware: 'The full version includes: Firefox ESR and Dillo (web browsers), ROX-Filer or ZzzFM (file managers), Geany (text editor), Claws Mail (email client), GNOME MPV (media player), LibreOffice, antiX TV, antiX Radio, and various system tools. The base version is leaner; core and net versions are aimed at completely minimalist installations.',
      hardwareCompatibility: 'AntiX is one of the distributions with the best support for old hardware available today. It runs on systems with processors as low as 256 MHz and 192 MB of RAM. 32-bit support allows installing the distro on computers from the Pentium III and Pentium 4 era — something remarkable in 2024. For more modern hardware, the 6.1 kernel ensures updated compatibility. AntiX also works excellently as a rescue system on a flash drive. Minimum requirements: x86 32 or 64-bit processor · 5 GB HDD/SSD · 512 MB RAM',
      communitySupport: 'The AntiX community is small but extremely dedicated. The official forum at antixforum.com is the primary support point, with experienced users answering questions about old hardware, init system configuration, and advanced customizations. Being based on Debian, all Debian documentation is equally valid and useful.',
      comparison: 'AntiX occupies a very specific niche: old hardware combined with total init system freedom. Compared to Puppy Linux, it offers a Debian base and greater compatibility with existing packages. Compared to MX Linux (which shares components with AntiX), it is more radical in its lightness and anti-systemd purity. For users who need to resurrect an old computer or who philosophically value the absence of systemd, AntiX is an absolute reference in the Linux ecosystem.'

En comparación con Puppy Linux, ofrece base Debian y mayor compatibilidad con los paquetes existentes. Frente a MX Linux (que comparte componentes de AntiX), es más radical en su ligereza y en su pureza anti-systemd. Para los usuarios que necesitan resucitar un ordenador viejo o que valoran filosoficamente la ausencia de systemd, AntiX es una referencia absoluta en el ecosistema Linux.'

Tamaño extremadamente reducido, con la versión base ocupando solo unos 11 MB (TinyCore) o 700 KB (Core puro). Modelo de extensiones modular, donde cada funcionalidad adicional se instala como un módulo independiente. Inicio extremadamente rápido, en pocos segundos incluso en hardware antiguo. Soporte de persistencia, que permite guardar configuraciones y extensiones en disco o pendrive. Totalmente portátil, pudiendo cargarse en un pendrive común y usarse en cualquier ordenador.',
      packageManager: 'TinyCore utiliza su propio sistema de extensiones llamado TCZ (TinyCore Extensions), gestionado por la herramienta gráfica AppBrowser o por el comando tce-load a través de la terminal. Las extensiones son módulos comprimidos que se cargan bajo demanda, sin necesidad de una instalación tradicional. El repositorio oficial cuenta con miles de extensiones disponibles, que cubren desde bibliotecas básicas hasta aplicaciones completas. Al ejecutarse en RAM, las extensiones deben recargarse en cada inicio, a menos que el usuario configure la persistencia.',
      preInstalledSoftware: 'Por su filosofía minimalista, TinyCore viene con lo mínimo absoluto. La versión TinyCore incluye: Terminal (BusyBox), Gestor de extensiones (AppBrowser), Editor de texto simple, Gestor de archivos básico y Navegador web ligero (Surf o similar, via extensión). Prácticamente todo el software adicional, incluyendo navegadores más completos, editores y herramientas de red, es instalado por el usuario según sea necesario a través de extensiones.',
      hardwareCompatibility: 'TinyCore fue diseñado para funcionar en hardware que otros sistemas simplemente ya no pueden soportar. Se ejecuta en procesadores x86 de 32 bits antiguos, además de soportar la arquitectura x86-64. Es compatible con ordenadores con cantidades mínimas de RAM, siendo funcional en máquinas con solo 64 MB de memoria en su versión más ajustada. Ideal para PCs antiguos de los años 2000, máquinas virtuales ligeras y entornos embebidos. Requisitos mínimos: Procesador 486DX (se recomienda Pentium 2 o superior), HD/SSD No obligatorio (se ejecuta en RAM), Memoria 64 MB (se recomiendan 128 MB para un uso cómodo).',
      communitySupport: 'La comunidad de TinyCore es pequeña pero extremadamente dedicada y técnica, concentrada principalmente en el foro oficial en tinycorelinux.net. Al ser un proyecto de nicho dirigido a usuarios avanzados, la documentación disponible es técnica y detallada, cubriendo desde la instalación básica hasta la creación de extensiones personalizadas. El soporte es totalmente comunitario y voluntario, con respuestas que suelen provenir de usuarios experimentados.',
      comparison: 'TinyCore ocupa un espacio único en el ecosistema Linux, prácticamente sin competidores directos en términos de tamaño y ligereza. En comparación con MiniOS o Puppy Linux, que ya se consideran ligeros, TinyCore está en otra categoría completamente: mientras que estas distros ocupan cientos de megabytes, TinyCore cabe en un disquete virtual. Se recomienda para usuarios con perfil técnico, ya que la experiencia requiere disposición para configurar y montar el sistema manualmente.'
